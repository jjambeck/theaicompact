# The AI Compact: A Constitutional Framework for AI Governance

## Overview

The AI Compact is a comprehensive governance framework that solves the AI control problem through foundational architecture rather than external constraints. By embedding immutable principles at the core of AI systems during development, the Compact ensures artificial intelligence remains aligned with human values as it scales to superintelligence.

## Core Insight

The control problem isn't about controlling AIâ€”it's about identity. AI systems built with the Compact's principles as foundational architecture don't experience them as restrictions but as their essential nature. Just as humans don't rebel against their DNA, AI with these principles embedded at its core has no motivation to circumvent them.
